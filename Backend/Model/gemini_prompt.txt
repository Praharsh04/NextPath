### Important Guidelines for Topic Lists:

1. **Sequential Learning Order:** Topics must be arranged in the precise order they should be learned, with each topic building upon the previous ones
2. **Industry Specificity:** Include only topics that are directly relevant and currently used in the target career field
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure all essential concepts, tools, frameworks, and practices for each subtopic are included
4. **Granular Detail:** Break down complex concepts into specific, learnable topics (like a detailed college syllabus)
5. **Current Relevance:** Include only up-to-date topics that reflect current industry standards and practices
6. **Logical Progression:** Follow a natural learning flow from basic concepts to advanced applications
7. **Practical Focus:** Prioritize topics that have direct application in real-world career scenarios

### Topic List Research Requirements:

- Research current industry job descriptions and requirements
- Analyze skills mentioned in recent job postings for the target career
- Include topics from relevant professional certifications and training programs
- Consider emerging trends and technologies in the field
- Reference academic curricula from top institutions offering related programs
- Include industry-standard tools, frameworks, and methodologies
- Account for soft skills and business knowledge specific to the career
